# ML_TinderAutomator
This Project was done by me independently and was inspired by a YouTube video by Code Drip. It uses selenium library of python to automate the browser activities and uses a Machine Learning model to detect faces in the profile picture and then tries to classify it as male or female and automatically likes the profiles of attractive women, so that you don't have to rigorously go through all the images. 


It can also be used to like men's profiles by setting the 'preferGirl' attribute of the TinderBot object.


It also downloads all the seen pictures and makes a list of all the image file links embedded in the Tinder website so that they can be downloaded later easily if anything goes wrong.
